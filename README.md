In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on improving overall quality of life, with increasing recognition of the pivotal role of sleep in achieving this goal. The quality of one's sleep greatly impacts one's well-being, productivity, and overall performance throughout the day. However, a large number of individuals lack knowledge about organizing their sleep schedules effectively, while some individuals face working conditions that require limited sleep periods. Hence, there is a need for appropriate strategies to determine optimal wake-up times and improve sleep quality. To meet this need, SleepWell platform is intended to improve sleep quality and match wake-up times to optimal sleep cycles. Users can easily monitor and improve their sleep quality by setting personalized wake-up times and performing accurate sleep cycle calculations. Furthermore, the platform integrates with sensor, allowing for continuous monitoring and analysis of sleep cycles, resulting in deeper insights and informed decisions that improve overall well-being.
